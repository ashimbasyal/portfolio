## 🛠️ Skills and Technologies Demonstrated

This project serves as a showcase of key skills in modern frontend development.

### **Core Frontend**

- **React:** Extensive use of hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useContext`) to build a reactive and modular application.
- **TypeScript:** Static typing for improved code safety, scalability, and maintainability.
- **Semantic HTML5:** Proper page structure for better accessibility and SEO.

### **Styling & UI/UX**

- **Tailwind CSS:** Fast and consistent UI development with a _utility-first_ approach. The theme (colors, fonts, shadows) is fully customized and dark-mode ready.
- **Design System:** A cohesive system defining colors, typography, and spacing for both light and dark themes.
- **User-Centered Design:** Attention to details, micro-interactions, clear visual hierarchy, and intuitive navigation for optimal UX.
- **Neumorphism:** Subtle shadow effects to create a tactile, modern interface.

### **Animation & Interactivity**

- **Framer Motion:** The leading animation library for React, used for:

  - Entry animations (`initial`, `animate`)
  - Scroll-based animations (`useScroll`, `useTransform`)
  - Hover and tap interactions (`whileHover`, `whileTap`)
  - Component presence management (`AnimatePresence`)

### **State Management**

- **React Context API:** Efficient global state management for theme handling, avoiding prop drilling.
- **State Lifting:** Used to share state between components (e.g., opening a project modal from a card click).

### **Accessibility (A11y)**

- **ARIA Attributes:** Use of `aria-label`, `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby` for improved accessibility, especially in forms.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** The entire app is navigable using only the keyboard.
- **Color Contrast:** Colors are chosen to ensure legibility in both light and dark modes.

### **Development Best Practices**

- **Modular Project Structure:** Organized into logical folders (`components`, `contexts`, `constants`, `types`) for easier navigation and maintenance.
- **Reusable Components:** Generic components (`SectionWrapper`, `ProjectCard`) promote DRY principles and consistency.
- **Performance Optimization:**

  - Inline theme script in `<head>` to prevent FOUC (_Flash of Unstyled Content_).
  - Optimized animations using `will-change` and `transform`.
  - Asynchronous font loading for faster rendering.
